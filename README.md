# CSS Exercises
These exercises are a set of CSS-related tasks designed to go along with The CLA's HTML and CSS content.

When doing these exercises, please use all the documentation and resources you need to accomplish them. You are _not_ intended to have any of this stuff memorized at this point. Check the docs, use Google, do what you need to do (besides checking the solutions) to get them done.

## How To Use These Exercises 

Fork and Clone the exercice's repository. Check out the GitHub documentation for [forking a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to remember how to fork a repository.

2. Open the HTML file in your browser after navigating to an exercise directory. Either open the file directly, or something like Live Server extension for VSCode.
3. Before beginning any work, make sure to carefully read the README.md.md for each exercise. There is a "Checklist" list in each README.md. Use this to check that you didn't forget to implement any crucial details.
4. Make the necessary changes to the "index.html" and/or "style.css" files to get your browser to display the output in the manner you want it to (s).
    * You might only need to edit one of these files, depending on the exercise's instructions.
5. Check the solution to make sure it matches yours after you successfully complete an exercise. You shouldn't check the answer to an exercise before you've finished it! Note that the provided solution is not the only one. Feel free to discuss your solution in the chatroom if it vastly deviates from ours (but still meets the checklist requirements).

### Hints

* Don't worry about getting the precise pixel value for elements like margin, padding, and font-size unless they are mentioned in the checklist section. Not your ability to guess that a screenshot uses "font: sans-serif bold 16px" or that the margin is _exactly_ "42px," but rather your knowledge of CSS, is what these exercises are meant to test.

* To put things in the proper place, you might need to add a few elements to your HTML. (For the first few exercises, we explicitly state when this must occur.)

* More selectors might need to be added to your CSS file. Nearly everything is done for you in the first few exercises, but as you advance, you'll discover that you need to add more and more to achieve the desired result.
